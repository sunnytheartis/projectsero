This is my project0: Google Search Engine.
The webpage is a basic html and css website.

Google Home is equipped with a google search and I'm feeling lucky search button for more exciting search. Both, when given a given text will give results based on the search.

Google Images is a basic search through Google's image search engine and gives you results based on what you enter into the search.

Google Advanced provides more of a specified search when entering the criteria such as "all these words", "This exact word of phrase","Any of these words", "None of these words" then takes you to search options after entering the given material.

All pages are made to look like google as close as possible, using pnj images and changing the font of the text. I even added a Google offered in espa√±ol on the home page, putting the 'image search' text under the Google logo and advanced page made to look like Google as close as possible.
